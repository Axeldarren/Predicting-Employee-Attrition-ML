# Predicting Employee Attrition with Random Forest Classifier

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using the Random Forest Classifier. The analysis includes Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the implementation of the classifier in a single Jupyter notebook. The dataset used in this project is the publicly available IBM employee attrition dataset.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. Additionally, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the IBM employee attrition dataset, which is publicly available.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The notebook includes a detailed EDA to understand the features and relationships in the dataset. Visualizations are created using Matplotlib and Seaborn to provide insights into the data.

## Modeling
The Random Forest Classifier is used to predict employee attrition. The model is trained and evaluated using various performance metrics.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. These results are discussed in the notebook.

## Usage
You can clone this repository and run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and model in action:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/employee-attrition-prediction.git
cd employee-attrition-prediction
jupyter notebook Predicting Employee Attrition Model.ipynb
```
